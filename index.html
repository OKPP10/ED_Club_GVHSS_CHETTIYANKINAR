            We are excited to announce the launch of the Entrepreneurship Development Club at GVHSS Chettiyanknar!
            This
            is
            the first time our school is establishing such a club, aimed at igniting and fostering entrepreneurial
            spirit
            among students. The club will serve as a platform for students to explore the fundamentals of
            entrepreneurship,
            develop critical skills like leadership, problem-solving, and creativity, and learn the importance of
            innovation
            in today's world. Through various activities, workshops, and mentorship sessions, the Entrepreneurship
            Development Club will empower students to transform ideas into actionable projects and even real-world
            ventures.
            Join us for the inauguration ceremony on November 6th to celebrate this milestone and to begin an
            inspiring
            journey of learning, growth, and enterprise!

        <h2 class="headings">Objectives</h2>
        <ul type="circle" class="para">
            <li>To inculcate both the technical skill and managerial skill in budding
                entrepreneurs</li>
            <li>Feasibility, prototype, and knowledge of the institutional research can
                be transferred to Entrepreneurship students through the scheme</li>
            <li>Opportunities abound for graduate students to develop independent
                projects and launch their own careers as researchers while working
                alongside faculty and assisting in their research.</li>
            <li>Field support from the department, research support from the research
                institutions and curriculum support from the university can be
                converged for young entrepreneurs to commercialise the potential
                projects</li>
            <li>Knowledge has become the new premium fuel for economic growth
                in the 21st century. Knowledge fuels new ideas and innovations to
                boost productivity and to create new products, new firms, new jobs,
                and new wealth. Some analysts estimate that knowledge-based
                activity accounts for half of the gross domestic product in Western
                industrialized countries.</li>
            <li>Serve as corporate headquarters for knowledge-based companies /
                organizations</li>

                areas
                including

                businesse</li>
            <li>Incubate knowledge-based business start-ups</li>
            <li>Some of the expected gains are more interdisciplinary research and

                and technology, more discoveries relevant to innovation, more
                knowledge based businesses and economic growth.</li>

                We are excited to announce the launch of the Entrepreneurship Development Club at GVHSS Chettiyanknar!
                This
                is
                the first time our school is establishing such a club, aimed at igniting and fostering entrepreneurial
                spirit
                among students. The club will serve as a platform for students to explore the fundamentals of
                entrepreneurship,
                develop critical skills like leadership, problem-solving, and creativity, and learn the importance of
                innovation
                in today's world. Through various activities, workshops, and mentorship sessions, the Entrepreneurship
                Development Club will empower students to transform ideas into actionable projects and even real-world
                ventures.
                Join us for the inauguration ceremony on November 6th to celebrate this milestone and to begin an
                inspiring
                journey of learning, growth, and enterprise!

            <h2 class="headings">OBJECTIVE</h2>
            <ul type="circle" class="para">
                <li>To inculcate both the technical skill and managerial skill in budding
                    entrepreneurs</li>
                <li>Feasibility, prototype, and knowledge of the institutional research can
                    be transferred to Entrepreneurship students through the scheme</li>
                <li>Opportunities abound for graduate students to develop independent
                    projects and launch their own careers as researchers while working
                    alongside faculty and assisting in their research.</li>
                <li>Field support from the department, research support from the research
                    institutions and curriculum support from the university can be
                    converged for young entrepreneurs to commercialise the potential
                    projects</li>
                <li>Knowledge has become the new premium fuel for economic growth
                    in the 21st century. Knowledge fuels new ideas and innovations to
                    boost productivity and to create new products, new firms, new jobs,
                    and new wealth. Some analysts estimate that knowledge-based
                    activity accounts for half of the gross domestic product in Western
                    industrialized countries.</li>
                <li>Serve as corporate headquarters for knowledge-based companies /
                    organizations</li>

                    technologies</li>

                <li>Catalyze development and delivery of information technologies,
                    biotechnologies,
                    other
                    scientific
                    areas
                    including
                    service-based
                    businesse</li>

                <li>Some of the expected gains are more interdisciplinary research and

                    and technology, more discoveries relevant to innovation, more
